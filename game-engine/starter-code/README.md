# Game Engine Tools - Starter Project

This workshop uses a prepared starter project so we can focus on learning Godot
tools and adding features.

- `platformer-starter-godot4.zip` (provided by instructor)

The starter project includes:

- A 2D platformer scene
- A player that can move + jump
- Coins that disappear when the player touches them
- The player always looks like the "idle" animation (even when moving)
- No score (yet)
